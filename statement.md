1. Problem Statement
In many small shops and general stores, shopkeepers still rely on manual methods like pen, paper, and handheld calculators to make bills. This method has problems such as:
•	Time-consuming: Writing item names and prices by hand takes time.
•	Calculation Errors: Humans often make mistakes while adding up totals or multiplying quantities, which leads to a loss of money for the shopkeeper or overcharging the customer.
2. Scope of the Project
This project aims to solve the above problems by making a computerized "Shop Bill Management System."
•	User can select items and quantity. All the data will be recorded as well so well-organised system.
•	The system handles the mathematical part (multiplication and addition) automatically to ensure accuracy.
•	It is designed for small-scale usage like bakery, or a small grocery store. It can be upgraded later on.
3. Target Users
The primary users of this software would be:
1.	Small Shop Owners: Who want to shift from paper bills to digital billing without buying expensive software.
2.	Cashiers/Counter Staff: Who need a tool to quickly calculate the total amount for a customer.
3.	Canteen Managers: In schools or offices where the menu is fixed and speed is important.
4. High-Level Features
•	Menu Display: The program automatically shows the list of available items and their prices so the user doesn't have to memorize them.
•	Search & Select: The user can simply type the name of the item to add it to the cart.
•	Calculation: The program instantly calculates the cost for each item (Price × Quantity) and updates the grand total.
•	Error Handling: If a user types an item that isn't in the shop, the program tells them to try again instead of crashing.
•	Invoice Generation: At the end, it generates a clean, readable bill showing the items purchased, quantities, and the final amount to be paid.
